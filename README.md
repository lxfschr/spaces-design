Photoshop Design Space [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adobe-photoshop/spaces-design.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adobe-photoshop/spaces-design)
=================

**Design Space is a new way to use Photoshop.** By combining the power of Photoshop with the flexibility of HTML5, Design Space provides a streamlined user interface to Photoshop and new experiences tailored just for design workflows. 

**Design Space is a work in progress.** We're still building essential features and experimenting with new ideas, and we want your help! Follow us on Twitter at [@psdesign](https://twitter.com/psdesign) for updates from the team. If you find a bug or have an idea for a new feature, please help us by [filing an issue](https://github.com/adobe-photoshop/spaces-design/issues/new). If you're an adventurous developer, you can [download and hack the HTML5 sources](https://github.com/adobe-photoshop/spaces-design/wiki/Design-Space-Development-Setup), and even submit pull requests.
